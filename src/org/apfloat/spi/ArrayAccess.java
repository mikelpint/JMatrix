/**
 * The <code>ArrayAccess</code> class simulates a <code>C</code> language pointer.
 * With one <code>ArrayAccess</code> object you can point to a location within an
 * array. You can easily add or subtract a value to this "pointer", thus
 * essentially emulating <code>C</code> pointer arithmetic. An <code>ArrayAccess</code>
 * provides an array, the starting index within that array and the length of
 * accessible data within the array, all in one convenient package.<p>
 *
 * Just like pointers in the <code>C</code> language, <code>ArrayAccess</code>
 * objects are inherently unsafe and must be used cautiously. It is the
 * responsibility of the user of an <code>ArrayAccess</code> object to make sure
 * that he doesn't access the provided array outside the allowed range. The
 * <code>ArrayAccess</code> object itself does nothing to enforce this, except
 * of course the mandatory bounds check of Java, which can throw an
 * <code>ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException</code>.
